High-Quality-Facial-Recognition-System

Project Idea : Facial recognition is the process of identifying or verifying the identity of a person using 
their face. It captures, analyzes, and compares patterns based on the person's facial details. High-Quality 
Facial Recognition System has many applications starting from mobile phones to security cameras. The face 
detection process is an essential step as it detects and locates human faces in images and videos. Project 

Solution: The objective of this project is to build a Facial Recognization application that can detect faces
and recognize them. We are going to build this using dlib which uses 128 point face detectors which outputs 
these 128 points fro all the face and compares them with existing faces.
